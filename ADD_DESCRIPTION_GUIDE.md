2. Look at the **right sidebar** of the repository page
3. Find the **"About"** section (usually below the green "Code" button)
4. If you see "No description, website, or topics" - click on the **pencil icon** (✏️) or **gear icon** (⚙️) next to it

   - Website (optional)
   - Topics

## Visual Guide

The About section is typically located:
- On the **right side** of the repository page
- Below the repository name and description area
- Above or below the "Releases" section
- It may show "No description" if nothing is set

## What to Look For

- A box/section that says "About" 
- Text that says "No description, website, or topics"
- A small pencil icon (✏️) or gear icon (⚙️) 
- Or just click anywhere in that "About" area

## Alternative: Direct URL

Try going directly to the settings page:
**https://github.com/raphathegreat/astro_explorer/settings**

Then scroll to find the "About" section in the General settings.
