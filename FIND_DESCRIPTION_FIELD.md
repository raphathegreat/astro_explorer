# Finding the Description Field in GitHub Settings

## You're in the Right Place!

If you can see "Repository name" that you can change, you're in the General settings section.

## Where to Find the Description Field

1. **Scroll down** on the same settings page
2. Look for a section called **"Features"** (below Repository name)
3. Keep scrolling past "Features"
4. You should see a section with:
   - **"Repository name"** (you found this!)
   - **"Description"** ← This is what you need!
   - **"Website"** (optional)
   - **"Topics"** (for keywords)

## If You Don't See It

The Description field might be:
- **Below** the Repository name field (scroll down a bit)
- In a **collapsed section** - look for a section header you can expand
- Sometimes it's labeled as **"About"** instead of "Description"

## Alternative: Look for These Sections

Scroll down and look for any of these section headers:
- "Repository details"
- "About"
- "General repository settings"
- Or just look for a text box labeled "Description"

## What the Description Field Looks Like

It's a **text input box** (not a dropdown) where you can type or paste:
```
Web dashboard for analyzing ISS orbital speed from AstroPi mission images using computer vision (OpenCV, SIFT, ORB algorithms). Features real-time speed calculations, advanced filtering, and interactive visualizations.
```

## Still Can't Find It?

Try this:
1. Press **Ctrl+F** (or Cmd+F on Mac)
2. Search for: **"Description"**
3. This will highlight where the field is on the page
