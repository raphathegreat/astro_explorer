# How to Add Topics on GitHub

## Method: Add One Topic at a Time

1. In the "Topics" field, **type the first topic**: `python`
2. **Press Enter** - it will create a tag/chip
3. **Type the next topic**: `flask`
4. **Press Enter** again
5. Repeat for each topic

## Example:
- Type: `python` → Press Enter → Creates a tag
- Type: `flask` → Press Enter → Creates a tag
- Type: `opencv` → Press Enter → Creates a tag
- And so on...

## Visual Guide:
You'll see each topic appear as a small tag/chip after pressing Enter. They should look like:
```
[python] [flask] [opencv] [computer-vision] ...
```

## Important:
- **DO NOT** type all topics separated by spaces in one go
- **DO** type one topic, press Enter, then type the next
- Each topic becomes its own tag/chip
