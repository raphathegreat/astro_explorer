    For any new feature or functionality added to the codebase:
    1. Always add comprehensive test cases to the test pack (realistic_test.py)
    2. Test cases should cover:
       - Basic functionality
       - Edge cases
       - Error handling
       - Integration with existing features
    3. Always run the test pack before declaring work complete
    4. Ensure all tests pass before finalizing changes
    5. If tests fail, fix the issues before completion
