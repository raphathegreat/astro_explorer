    For any change that affects the user interface or user experience:
    1. Always verify that all frontend aspects are properly covered:
       - HTML structure and elements
       - CSS styling and layout
       - JavaScript functionality and event handlers
       - UI responsiveness and accessibility
    2. Check that UI elements are visible and functional:
       - All form controls (inputs, sliders, dropdowns, checkboxes)
       - All buttons and interactive elements
       - All tooltips and help text
       - All data displays and visualizations
    3. Ensure CSS classes are defined and properly styled:
       - No missing CSS classes that would hide elements
       - Consistent styling with existing UI patterns
       - Proper responsive design for different screen sizes
    4. Test UI functionality end-to-end:
       - User interactions work as expected
       - Data flows correctly from frontend to backend
       - Error states and edge cases are handled
    5. Verify visual consistency:
       - Colors, fonts, and spacing match design system
       - Icons and visual elements are properly displayed
       - Layout doesn't break with new elements
